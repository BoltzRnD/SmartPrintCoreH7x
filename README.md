The SmartPrintCoreH7x is an open-source 3D printer mainboard based on the STM32H7 series microcontroller. It includes 5+1 stepper drivers, with the option to expand by adding more sets of 5 drivers through the upcoming "SmartPrintCore Extravaganza". With a jumper-less setup and a design built for flexibility, SmartPrintCoreH7x is dedicated for makers, tinkerers, and the industry to build and customize.

The Board utilizes self-locking Molex MegaFit(Power Input), Ultra-Fit Tangless (Hotend Heaters), Mini-Lock(Motors and power peripherals) and JST-GH (Digital and IO Peripherals), for easy and worry-free connections.

![Self-Locking Connectors](Media//ConnectorsImg.png "Self-Locking Connectors in Action")
![Self-Locking Connectors](Media//SmartPrintCoreH7x_mot_ports.png "Self-Locking Connectors in Action")

The board also includes multiple TI Buck converters with more than 90% efficiencies for multiple peripherals
1. 12V 5A Fan and Peripheral Supply
2. 5V 5A Fan and Peripheral supply
3. 5V 10A SBC Supply (Optional, Can be powered by Peripheral Supply, using resistor jumpers in production)

Other notable features include -
1. Compatibility with 12V/24V power supplies
2. Auto power source selection for Board supply from USB/Main Supply.

Theraml Considerations - 
1. Low RDS(on) Mosfets are used for minimal losses, which also allows heatsink-less operation for average use cases
2. The PCB design prioritizes heat management, with strategically placed components and optimized power traces that ensure optimal cooling.

## Design Considerations
To optimize general usage and simplify installation, the following design features have been incorporated:

1. **External Inline Fuses**: Installed beyond the power supply line for easy fuse replacement without the need to dismantle the mainboard section of your printer.
2. **Pre-Configured Stepper Jumpers**:
   - Jumpers are preset to high using 0402 resistors, eliminating the need for manual adjustments.
   - MSX bit changes are managed via firmware if you are utilizing hardware settings.
   - Note: A4988/DRV8266 and SPI-based drivers cannot be mixed and used concurrently without soldering additional 0402 configuration resistors.

# Story Time

### How It Was Created
SmartPrintCoreH7x was born out of a combination of long commute hours and a renewed passion for building. With 7 hours a day of travel time, a result of embarking on an exciting single life, there was a great opportunity to reconnect with my hobby of creating innovative hardware. Fueled by endless cups of Chai Tea and free time, I found a new rhythm between the rails and circuits.

### Why It Was Created
The motivation behind SmartPrintCoreH7x is rooted in both personal need and a broader vision for the 3D printing community:
- **High-Speed Performance**: Designed to handle extremely high printing speeds of 3000 mm/s or more.
- **Unmatched Control**: Providing complete control over the hardware, allowing for extensive customization and modification at any time to meet evolving needs, for any organization and individuals.
- **Reliable and Easy Connections**: To eliminate common issues with connectivity in intensive printing operations.
- **Open Source Commitment**: Ensuring the hardware remains open and accessible, allowing anyone to modify and improve upon the design without restriction.
- **Safety and Reliability**: Integrating robust power supplies to safeguard the system, particularly enhancing the performance and reliability of connected Single Board Computers (SBCs).

# Commitment to Open Source

**Note:** In celebration of our dedication to open-source hardware and software, Boltz R&D endorses the use of BeaglePlay and BeagleBone SBCs with SmartPrintCoreH7X. We are committed to actively supporting the community by ensuring seamless interfacing and integration of these setups or similar setups.

# Extra notes

1. Marlin Configuration is still under development, Please Raise a requirement on discord to prioritize it above other tasks if needed.
2. The Component Libraries are not included and redistributed because of license restrictions, contact us to join our organisation as a "contributor" to access the part libraries for development.
3. Custom 3D Printed casing is under development and evaluation, and is expected to release by end of May 2024.
4. The Klipper Configuration files are minimal, and will require some modifications to fit your use case, reach out to us whenever in doubt.
5. Feel Free to reach out to our discord server for any queries related to integration, development and production.
6. You can also send us feature requests that you'd like to see in the next versions of the board.
